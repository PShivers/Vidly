Application made while learning/reviewing ASP.MVC fundamentals.
I am following along with [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/) 
to have a better understanding of some basics that have been overlooked/neglected while trying to get my job done.

Mosh has a great way of teaching, and only a couple hours in I have gotten several answers to standing questions I have had.

I plan on using this project to learn about automated testing as well.
